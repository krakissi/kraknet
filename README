Kraknet Site System

A stand alone web server (httpd) designed to serve CGI in an intuitive and
convenient way.

init_ws:
	This file is used to start and stop the server. It behaves like a System V
	init script. If this were a permanent set up, this script would be in
	/etc/init.d

Directories in /home/ghandi and what they mean:
	web/
		This is the live web directory. Everything here is available on the
		internet in exactly the way it's laid out.

	mods/
		Kraknet modules are stored here, with all of their scripts. Each module
		should have an info.txt file telling Kraknet how to map a request for a
		script to an actual file inside the module's directory.

	conf/
		Config files here.
			mime: MIME type definitions. If a file isn't being served in the way
			you would like, you can change it here.

			serv: Server configuration. Changes made here are live immediately
			without restarting the server. BE CAREFUL.

	src/o/
		Binary object files. These are useless, unless you need to link with
		them to compile some core feature of the server or Kraknet into your
		C application.

	src/i/
		Header files. Make sure you link with the relevant object code from o/

	bin/
		Binaries for the server. Anything here will be available in the path of
		all CGI scripts. Be careful about what you put here.

	db/
		A suggested location for storing database files. The system's database
		files (SQLite3) will be available here, including kraknet.db which has
		user information.
